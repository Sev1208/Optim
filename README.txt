Forward Models: 

Mogi, McTigue and Okada models are working as forward models but also in the inversion.
BMO is able to find the parameters of both models.

The matrix covariance is symmetric and but be inverted. 
It's inverse is also symmetric and tu make sure it's really symmetric : cov_1=(cov_1 + t^cov_1)/2

Parameters at their original scale (dvol m^3, x, y, z in m).
Inversion for tilt data.

Working for tilt data with diagonal covariance matrix. Should also give good results for general covariance matrix.
